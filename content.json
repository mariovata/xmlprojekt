    "title": "Introduction to Astronomy",
    "description": "Astronomy (from Greek: ἀστρονομία, literally meaning the science that studies the laws of the stars) is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets. Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates beyond Earth's atmosphere. Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole. Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made...",

    "description": "Stargazing is a calming and fun activity to most, but how do you do it? Go into your garden, and look up at the night sky. That’s how easy it starts. You might be wondering, what now If you want to know what you are looking at, you can use multiple tools to learn. Remembering what is where, will give a sense of satisfaction. There are apps that use Augmented Reality to show you what is there, maps for the sky called planispheres and light pollution maps, magazines talking about what is where and when and star atlasses. Though you can start stargazing in your backyard, the best possible location is in a dark area, with no light pollution. Find the best locations here.",

    "title": "Vacuum decay: the ultimate catastrophe",
    "description": "Every once in a while, physicists come up with a new way to destroy the Universe. There’s the Big Rip  (a rending of spacetime), the Heat Death (expansion to a cold and empty Universe), and the Big Crunch (the reversal of cosmic expansion)Like an electric field, the Higgs field varies in strength, based on its potential. Think of the potential as a track on which a ball is rolling. The higher it is on the track, the more energy the ball has. The Higgs potential determines whether the Universe is in one of two states: a true vacuum, or a false vacuum. A true vacuum is the stable, lowest-energy state, like sitting still on a valley floor. A false vacuum is...",
